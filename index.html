    <h1>Hey! It's a page</h1>
    <a href="https://dillinger.io/"><img src="img/nose1.jpeg" alt="nose with ass"></a>
    <p>For good measure, we have created a brand new page, with brand new ideas.</p>
    <h2>All ideas contained within this page are 100% Original.</h2>
    <p>They were concocted just today, just now</p>

    <h2>Here are some ideas</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>There's a lot of repitition in making pages</li>
      <li>Repitition is good for learning</li>
      <li>Repitition is kind of bad if you already have learned those skills</li>
      <li>Repitition is a repeating kind of action</li>
      <li>If you repeat a word in your mind over and over it starts to lose meaning</li>
